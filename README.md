# Lemonade: InsurTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Lemonade Insurance Company

* Founded April 2015

* Founders: 
  Daniel Schreiber, Chief Executive Officer
  Shai Wininger, Chief Operating Officer

Lemonade Insurance Company started with the idea of changing how insurance companies operate and restructuring the traditional insurance model into a more socially beneficial structure. Lemonade uses technology to approve renter’s and homeowner’s insurance policies and insurance claims rapidly through a mobile app. Lemonade takes a fixed percentage fee of premiums from consumers for their expenses and donates the excess to a consumer-chosen charitable organization annually as part of their “Giveback” program. Lemonade is an InsurTech company. Lemonade Insurance Company received $13 million in seed funding from Sequoia Capital, Aleph, and Expansion Venture Capital in December of 2015. Including this seed funding, Lemonade has received a total of $479.2 million in funding to date. Additional investors include Thrive Capital, General Catalyst, Tusk Ventures, GV, XL Innovate, Counterpart Advisors, Allianz, SoftBank, OurCrowd, Inventure Partners, and eBrands.vc . As of June 2020, Lemonade has begun IPO filing.


## Business Activities:

Lemonade is trying to reduce insurance fraud, conduct technology-driven insurance risk analysis, and increase consumption of renter’s and homeowner’s insurance policies among a younger and more digitally fluent demographic. Lemonade’s intended customers are younger, digitally-savvy adults. This demographic is categorized generally as millennials who are also the largest generation within the United States workforce currently. This targeted demographic is one of the largest groups of consumers within the U.S., outnumbering other generations in terms of market size. Solutions that Lemonade are offering as a company include repositioning the consumer to be on the same “team” as them, utilizing Artificial Intelligence for risk analysis, and focused digital marketing. Lemonade repositions the consumer by donating the excess to their chosen charity, displaying that any claims reduce the donation amount which disincentivizes their customers from making fraudulent claims. This implementation poses a shared cause to customers. Lemonade integrates behavioral economics, data, and artificial intelligence to create an inventive and modern insurance company structure. Lemonade is currently using artificial intelligence in the form of chatbots on their mobile app. Their chatbot named Maya discusses insurance coverage options with consumers and another chatbot named Jim is implemented as an artificial intelligence “Personal Claim Assistant”. Jim is synced with various anti-fraud algorithms to instantly approve the majority of claims, the claims that cannot be instantly approved are investigated by a human team. These chatbots are implemented with CX.ai as well as Natural Language Processing via python which is used to make these interactions smoother for consumers. Signals and alerts from Lemonade’s Project watchtower integrate with their artificial intelligence solutions by detecting and short-term predicting events that can influence claims volumes with the use of satellite mapping data from NASA. Artificial intelligence is implemented further again in underwriting by collecting more data-points than typical insurance policy forms. Lemonade employs a cloud-computing platform for managing, handling, and storing data. Other major companies within the InsurTech domain include Oscar, Gusto, Bright Health, Clover Health, Root Insurance, and Hippo. Lemonade maintains an advantage as they offer separate types of insurance policies than these other major InsurTech players, many of which are more centrally focused on health insurance within the United States.

## Landscape:

Lemonade is operating in the insurance (InsurTech) domain of the financial industry. The major trends of the InsurTech sector over the last 5-10 years have centered around deep usage of Big Data and artificial intelligence. These core focuses have been used to better understand consumers, grow market share, improve operational efficiency while reducing business costs compared to traditional insurance companies, reduce consumer costs, and enhance customer experience. A major trend in InsurTech is transparency to consumers to improve their opinions toward insurance thereby increasing consumption volume and improving revenue with a larger consumer base.

Lemonade maintains an advantage as they offer separate types of insurance policies than these other major InsurTech players, many of which are more centrally focused on health insurance within the United States.

## Results

The business impact of Lemonade so far has been a change of insurance industry perspectives toward traditional models. Lemonade has exploded with growth, especially among consumers under 35. Lemonade has demonstrated that new entrants to the insurance industry are better off being technology companies that do insurance, rather than a traditionally modeled insurance company. Some of the core metrics that are used to measure success across companies in the insurance industry are average revenue per policyholder, average cost per claim, and loss ratio. Lemonade is not currently a public company, but they maintain a fixed percentage currently equal to 25% per premium while paying out any claims with the excess that has already been set aside for charity donations. Lemonade went from zero annual recurring revenue to $100 million in about 3 years. They have continued improving their loss ratio, the ratio paid out in claims to earnings, from 368% in Q1 of 2017 to 78% in Q3 of 2019. This is already lower than the average of the top insurance companies while still heading downward. In comparison to competitors, Lemonade’s growth is unmatched in the renter’s and homeowner’s insurance policy sector.


## Recommendations

If I were advising Lemonade, I would recommend that they maintain their strong focus on growth and continue employing analysis on shifting consumer views of insurance which has helped them grow as a company. Beyond continuing to do what they already are doing so well, I would recommend that with their most recent funding they begin experimenting and research into offering additional insurance coverage policies. More specifically, they should begin research insights and development of offering car insurance coverage policies. The market size of the car insurance industry in the United States is $308.8 billion. This is a massive additional market they are well positioned to enter through their current technology implementations to grow their user base and annual recurring revenue. Lemonade already uses phone camera videos to aid in claims. I propose they develop a small technology that can be attached in a concealed way to their consumers’ automobiles if they opt for coverage that can send additional data points back to their already developed technology infrastructure. With this additional data they can more accurately offer car insurance coverage policies and continue to utilize customer phone video reports on claims, which in this case are for potential car wrecks/damages. They can use the small attached technology to verify along with the customer video. This opens a cheaper option for car insurance coverage for consumers and a massive potential new line of revenue for Lemonade.
